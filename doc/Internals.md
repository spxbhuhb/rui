# Notes

## Coding Conventions

In the compiler plugin source code function names follows these conventions:

- `init*` functions are called during instance initialization
- `build*` functions are called from `RuiClassBuilder.build` (maybe deeper in the chain), they do no return with
  anything
- `ir*` functions create and return with `IrElement` instances
- `trace*` functions add trace code when it is enabled in the plugin configuration by the `withTrace` option

## Definitions

A *component* is a class that extends `RuiFragment` and has its own *component state*. The
state may be empty. The compiler plugin generates components from *original functions*.
It is also possible to manually write a component, actually most low-level components
that interact with the underlying UI are written manually.

An *original function* is a function the UI programmer writes and is annotated with `@Rui`.
The compiler plugin turns original functions into a *components*.

A *structural* is a general building block used by *components* to build the structure of
the rendered UI. These are pre-defined by the Rui runtime: `RuiBlock`, `RuiWhen`,
`RuiLoop`. Structurals do not have a state, they use the state of the component they are
defined in when deciding how to render the UI.

A *fragment* is a *component* or a *structural*. Fragments are the building blocks of
the runtime Rui structure.

A *higher-order function* is a Rui function that gets a Rui function as a parameter.

A *parameter function* is a function passed as parameter to a *higher-order function*.

A *state variable* is a property of a *component*, part of the *component state*.

An *external state variable* is a *state variable* that is derived from a parameter of
the *original function*.

An *internal state variable* is a *state variable* that is derived from a variable defined
in the body of the *original function*.

The *runtime* is the `hu.simplexion.zakadabar:rui-runime` module. This contains base
classes and interfaces. It is important that this is a "static" runtime, there is no
engine running in the background to perform updates.

## External Patch

External patch functions update the external state variables of a component.

They are part of the parent component because they are call-site dependent.
Two different call sites may need two different external patch functions.
In the example below patching the two T1 components requires two different computations.

```kotlin
@Rui
fun test(i: Int) {
  T1(i + 1)
  T1(i + 2)
}
```

Declaration of external patch functions could be done with:

- lambdas,
- functions defined in the component, their reference passed as a parameter.

Lambdas are a bit easier to define but on JVM they result on a new class generated.
That may raise the problem of long application startup, therefore it seems better
to stick to function definitions.

Name of generated external patch functions is `ruiEpX` where `X` is the start offset
of the original function call the external patch belongs to.

```kotlin
fun ruiEp543(it: RuiT1) {
    if (ruiDirty0 and 2 != 0) { // 2 is the mask for `this.value`
        it.p0 = this.value * 2
        it.ruiInvalidate(1) // 1 is the mask of `it.p0`
    }
}
```

External patch of higher order functions and loop blocks is complicated. See
Higher-Order Functions for details.

## Bridge

The bridge connects Rui fragments with their representation in the underlying
UI. Low-level fragments (those that directly interact with the actual UI)
typically implement the `RuiBridge` interface and transform their internal
state into an actual UI state.

The `BT` type parameter of the bridge is a type in the underlying UI, typically
ancestor of all UI elements, such as `Node` in HTML or `View` in Android.

`ruiMount` and `ruiUnmount` functions get the bridge of the parent fragment
and use `add` and `remove` methods to add and remove themselves. Some bridges
also implement the `replace` method which makes it possible to replace a
fragment with another in place. This is used by `if` and `when`.

### Bridge dependent and bridge independent fragments

A bridge independent fragment is one that does not depend on the actual type
its bridge uses. On the other hand, a bridge dependent fragment is one
that uses the bridge in some very specific manner.

For example `RuiBlock` is a bridge independent fragment. It does not care
about what goes on, it just has a few children, and they will handle the
bridging themselves.

`Text` fragments are typically bridge dependent because each platform has its
own way to add constant text to the UI. In browsers for example you use
`document.createTextNode`.

Bridge independent fragments use type parameter for the bridge receiver type:

```kotlin
open class RuiBlock<BT>(
    override val ruiAdapter: RuiAdapter<BT>,
    vararg val fragments: RuiFragment<BT>
) : RuiFragment<BT> {
    // ...
}
```

Fragments generated by the plugin are bridge independent, thus usable with any
kind of adapter/bridge.

## Placeholders

A placeholder is an anchor the fragment uses to add/remove its children. We cannot
just add and then replace fragments because it is possible that the selected
fragment is a block or a loop. Those add an unknown number of children, thus simple
replace is impossible. For browsers the placeholder may be a simple `Node`
(Svelte uses a `Text`), for Android an actual Placeholder view exists.

Placeholders are created by the `RuiAdapter.createPlaceholder` function.
